Association Between Depression Symptoms and Emotional Communication Dynamics

Enclosed you will find the data and code necessary to replicate the analyses described in the manuscript _Association Between Depression Symptoms and Emotional Communication Dynamics_ (Gregory et al., Under Review at Clinical Psychological Science). 

The study and results enclosed were not preregistered. The procedures described herein were approved by the McGill University Research Ethics Board (REB# 201-1015). Data for these analyses were drawn from a larger study, in which we created a library of empathic accuracy stimulus videos to examine both target and perceiver characteristics that influence empathic accuracy and empathic responding. 

**Abstract**: Communicating emotional experiences effectively is critical for adaptive functioning and personal and interpersonal well-being. Here, we investigated whether variability in depression symptoms undermines people’s ability to express their emotions to others (“emotional expressive accuracy”), and how those communication dynamics influence other’s impressions. In Phase I, 49 “targets” were videotaped describing significant autobiographical events; they then watched their videos and continuously rated how positive/negative they were feeing throughout the narrative. In Phase II, 171 “perceivers” watched subsets of videos from targets and similarly rated each target’s affect. Results from 1647 unique target-perceiver observations indicate a link between target’s depressive symptoms and impaired emotional expressive accuracy for positive events (B=-0.002, t(1501)=-3.152, p=0.002). Similarly, more depressive targets were rated less favourably by perceivers, again when sharing positive events (B=-.012, t(1511)=-10.145, p<.001). Given the beneficial effects of capitalization—sharing positive experiences with others—these findings may illustrate one link between depressive symptoms and impoverished relationships.
